# Object-Detection-in-Image
This is a small project on Object Detection in Images . The code is entirely written in Python and the IDE used is Jupyter Notebook . The library mainly used is OpenCV . 
Although we can custom feed the colour which we want to detect but to make the project a bit more interesting I have added trackers ! Trackers will help us to select the 
colour we want to detect by just sliding the given trackers on screen . The l_h and u_h will help us select which colour we want to detect , l_s and u_s will help us select
which colour shade we want to detect and the l_v and u_v will help us select the sharplness/brightness of the colour we want to detect .
